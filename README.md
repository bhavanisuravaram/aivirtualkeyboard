# 🖥️ AI Virtual Keyboard (Hand Gesture-Based)  

An AI-powered virtual keyboard using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** for real-time **hand tracking and gesture recognition**. This project enables **touchless typing** by detecting finger movements and mapping them to a virtual keyboard displayed on the screen.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Hand Tracking with MediaPipe** – Detects and tracks hand movements  
✅ **Gesture-Based Typing** – Type letters by pointing your index finger at virtual keys  
✅ **Space & Delete Gestures** – Special keys for spacing and deleting characters  
✅ **Real-Time Visual Feedback** – Highlights the pressed keys for better interaction  
✅ **Custom Keyboard Layout** – Modify key placement and add more functionality

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
🔹 **Python** – Core programming language  
🔹 **OpenCV** – Real-time video processing for hand tracking  
🔹 **MediaPipe** – AI-based hand tracking and gesture recognition  
🔹 **NumPy** – Gesture calculations  
🔹 **CV2 GUI** – Displays the virtual keyboard
