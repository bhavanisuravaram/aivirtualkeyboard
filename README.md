# 🖥️ AI Virtual Mouse (Hand Gesture-Based)  

An AI-powered virtual mouse using **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **AutoPy** to enable touchless interaction with a computer. This system tracks hand gestures and moves the cursor accordingly, allowing users to click, move, and interact without a physical mouse.

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Hand Tracking & Gesture Recognition** – Uses **MediaPipe Hand Tracking** to detect finger positions  
✅ **Cursor Control with Finger Movements** – Moves the mouse based on index finger motion  
✅ **Click Gesture Detection** – Clicks when all fingers are up  
✅ **Smooth Cursor Movements** – Interpolated cursor movement for a natural feel  
✅ **Real-Time Processing** – Works with live webcam feed
